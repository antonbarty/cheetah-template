# Default .ini file for crystal hit finding
# Includes new keywords introduced in v2014.4
#
# Notes:
# 1) CXI have been swapping around CSPAD detectors and therefore the
# name of the detectors in each position have been changing frequently.
# Sometimes the front detector is CXI:DS1 and sometimes it is CXI:DS2
# Change this in the psana.cfg file 
#
# 2) Make sure to update both the detector name and encoder PV name.
#
# 3) Some ASICs may not have unbonded pixels any more (Jan 2016) in 
# which case commonModeCorrection=asic_unbonded does not work.
# 
# 4) Darkcal files and bad pixel masks need to be changed to match 
# the detector in use
